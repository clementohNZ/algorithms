# Caesar Cipher

## Purpose
More complex performance optimization. Have to figure out how to continue iterating through an
array beyond the current index and achieve the same effect of looping through an array
say 500 times without actually doing it 500 times.

## Exercise Details
The function should take in a string and shift each character either forward (if passed
a positive number) or conversely backwards (if passed a negative number) `n` amount of
spaces. If it reaches either end of the word, it will loop continue from the other end.

```js
function ceasarCipher(string, number) {}
```
