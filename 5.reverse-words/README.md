# Reverse Words

## Purpose
Test problem solving skills. If you cannot use one of the built in methods, can you
build it yourself?

Can you identify different ways of doing something (because there is more than one way)
and then determine which is more efficient

## Exercise Details
Take in a sentence and reverse every word inside that sentence.

Rules:
1. Every word should be reversed but the string as a whole should not be reversed
2. Do not use the array.reverse() method

```js
function reverseWords(string, number) {}
```
