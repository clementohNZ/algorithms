# Is Palindrome

## Purpose
Basic solutioning. Understanding you have to strip out the punctuation and lowercase
all the characters to make it work.

## Exercise Details
Returns true if the string is a palindrome and false if it isn't.

A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward, for example:

1. race car
2. madam, I'm adam
3. nurses run

```js
function isPalindrome(string) {}
```

## Further Challenge
This exercise is fairly easy. If you want a much harder algorithmic exercise, try:
1. A different way to solve the issue
2. Determine if a random set of characters has the potential to form a valid palindrome
3. Determine how many potential palindromes can be generated from a random set of chracters
